        <h2>Instructions</h2>


    <ol>
        <li>Char the whole eggplants until the flesh is soft and the skin is almost black. We like to roast the eggplants over medium to medium-low heat on a gas burner (directly on the flame) until charred all around, flipping it with tongs to prevent burning our hands. You can line your stovetop around the flame with aluminum foil for easier clean-up. The eggplants can also be roasted on a grill or broil it in the oven on a baking pan.</li>
        <li>Once charred, set the eggplant aside on a plate or baking dish to cool for at least 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, add a tablespoon of oil to a large pan. Once heated, add onions and garlic and saute until soft, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked onion and garlic mixture to a wide and shallow bowl or container. Add in the vegan egg, vegan fish sauce, salt, and ground black pepper. Mix until uniform and set aside.</li>
        <li>Peel the charred skin off of the eggplant. It is ok if a small amount of charred skin remains.</li>
        <li>Using the back of a fork, Flatten each eggplant so that it fans out into a wide teardrop shape.</li>
        <li>Heat a tablespoon of oil in your pan.</li>
        <li>Dip the flattened eggplant into your prepared vegan egg mixture and add it to the heated pan. Spoon over about 1/4 cup more of the egg mixture over the top. If it starts to spread out, you can use your spatula or cooking utensil to push it back towards the eggplant. Pan-fry for about 3 minutes on one side, or until golden and crispy. Flip and cook the second side until golden. Continue with the remaining eggplants.</li>
        <li>Serve with rice and banana ketchup. Enjoy!</li>
